React Native Expo Foodie App

Final project for IBM Sub Module part of Android development Professional Certified Course by Coursera.

Task: Build a user-friendly recipe application using react native and expo that allows people to discover, add, and save their favorite recipes.  When you open the app, you will land on the main feed. At the top of the feed, you'll notice a horizontal scroll bar showcasing different categories of dishes. Selecting any category makes it easy for you to filter recipes based on your preferences. The main feed is fully scrollable, allowing you to browse various recipes submitted by others. Each recipe card displays an image of the dish and its name.
Clicking any recipe card will take you to that recipe's details page. Once you select a recipe, the recipe detail page opens.

Additionally, the page provides details such as preparation time required to make the dish. The number of servings the recipe yields, calories per serving. The difficulty level of the recipe helps you gauge the effort needed. If you like the recipe, you can tap the Favorite button on the top, right to save it to your favorites. The button works as a toggle, allowing you to easily unfavorite the recipe by selecting it again.
